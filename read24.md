What is a Hashtable?

Terminology:

1. Hash - A hash is the result of some algorithm taking an incoming string and converting it into a value that could be used for either security or some other purpose. In the case of a hashtable, it is used to determine the index of the array.
2. Buckets - A bucket is what is contained in each index of the array of the hashtable. Each index is a bucket. An index could potentially contain multiple key/value pairs if a collision occurs.
3. Collisions - A collision is what happens when more than one key gets hashed to the same location of the hashtable.

Why do we use them?

1. Hold unique values
2. Dictionary
3. Library

What Are they

Hashtables are a data structure that utilize key value pairs. This means every Node or Bucket has both a key, and a value.

The basic idea of a hashtable is the ability to store the key into this data structure, and quickly retrieve the value. This is done through what we call a hash. A hash is the ability to encode the key that will eventually map to a specific location in the data structure that we can look at directly to retrieve the value.

Since we are able to hash our key and determine the exact location where our value is stored, we can do a lookup in an O(1) time complexity. This is ideal when quick lookups are required.

Let’s say we have data of Seattle neighborhood names and their corresponding zip codes.

```py
["Greenwood:98103", "Downtown:98101", "Alki Beach:98116", "Bainbridge Island:98110", ...]
```

Now, we want to be able to search through the data to look up a neighborhood and obtain it’s zip code. We could do this using a for loop that looks through each piece of data one by one until it finds the neighborhood name, then returns the zip code there. This would be an O(N) read operation because it requires searching through each piece of data to find the one piece we want.

Arrays actually have fast access. If we know the index of the information we want we can access that information in O(1) time. The reason why searching for a piece of data in a collection is O(N) isn’t because the array is slow, it’s just that we have to look through all N things in the collection.

Hash maps take advantage of an array’s O(1) read access. Instead of adding elements to an array from beginning to end, a hash map uses a “hash function” to place each item at a precise index location, based off it’s key.

Basically, the hash function takes a key and returns an integer. We use the integer to determine where the key/value pair should be placed in the array. The hash code is calculated in constant time and writing to an array at one index is O(1) so the hash map has O(1) access.

Structure
Hashing
Basically, a hash code turns a key into an integer. It’s very important that hash codes are deterministic: their output is determined only by their input. Hash codes should never have randomness to them. The same key should always produce the same hash code.

Creating a Hash
A hashtable traditionally is created from an array. I always like the size 1024. this is important for index placement. After you have created your array of the appropriate size, do some sort of logic to turn that “key” into a numeric number value. Here is a possible suggestion:

1. Add or multiply all the ASCII values together.
2. Multiply it by a prime number such as 599.
3. Use modulo to get the remainder of the result, when divided by the total size of the array.
4. Insert into the array at that index.

```py
Key = "Cat"
Value = "Josie"

67 + 97 + 116 = 280

280 * 599 = 69648

69648 % 1024 = 16

Key gets placed in index of 16. 
```

Collisions

A collision occurs when more than one key hashes to the same index in an array. As mentioned earlier, a “perfect hash” will never have any collisions. To put this into perspective, the worst possible hash is one that hashes every single key to the same exact index of an array. The more keys you have hashed to a specific index, the more key/value pair combos you can potentially have.

Collisions are solved by changing the initial state of the buckets. Instead of starting them all as null we can initialize a LinkedList in each one! Now if two keys resolve to the same index in the array then their key/value pairs can be stored as a node in a linked list. Each index in the array is called a “bucket” because it can store multiple key/value pairs.

Since different keys can lead to the same bucket it’s important to store the entire key/value pair in the bucket, not just the value. The key must be stored with the value! If only values were stored in buckets then it would be impossible to determine which value to return when a key led you to a bucket.
